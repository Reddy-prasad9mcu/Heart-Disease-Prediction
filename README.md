## 🎯 Problem Statement
Build a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on medical attributes.

## 📚 Attribute Information
- **Age**: Patient age in years
- **Sex**: Male/Female
- **ChestPainType**: Chest pain type
- **RestingBP**: Resting blood pressure (mm Hg)
- **Cholesterol**: Serum cholesterol (mg/dl)
- **FastingBS**: Fasting blood sugar >120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)
- **RestingECG**: Resting electrocardiogram result
- **MaxHR**: Maximum heart rate achieved
- **ExerciseAngina**: Exercise-induced angina (Y/N)
- **Oldpeak**: ST depression induced by exercise
- **ST_Slope**: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
- **HeartDisease**: Target variable (1 = disease, 0 = normal)

## 🛠️ Work Done
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Handling categorical variables with Encoding
- Feature Scaling/Normalization
- Model Building:  
    - RandomForestClassifier
    - XGBoostClassifier
- Achieved an accuracy of **86%**

## 📊 Results
- Random Forest Accuracy: 86%
- XGBoost Accuracy: 86%
- Both models performed well, with XGBoost slightly more stable across validation sets.

## 📈 Future Work
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Trying ensemble models
- Further feature engineering

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost)
